\wde{Dimensionality Reduction}{
    Dimensionality reduction is the process of reducing the number of features in a dataset.
    This is used for visualisation, exploration and compression.
}
\wde{Principal Component Analysis (PCA)}{
    PCA is a method for dimensionality reduction. It finds the directions that maximise the variance in the data. These 
    directions are called principal components. Each principle component is orthogonal to the others. 
}
\wde{Maximum Variance Formulation}{
    An optimisation problem that PCA solves is to find the directions that maximise the variance in the data.
    This can be solved with lagrange multipliers.
