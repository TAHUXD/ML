    % draw a graph where U -> Smoking and U-> Stroke and Smoking -> HIV and Smoking -> Stroke and HIV -> Stroke and Age -> HIV and Age -> Stroke and Age -> Smoking
      Let $U$ be the unknown or unmeasured variable. $S$ be smoking, $St$ be stroke, $H$ be HIV and $A$ be age.

        \draw[draw=green,->] (age) -- (smoke);
      \end{tikzpicture}
      \end{center}
      If we were investigating the relationship between smoking and stroke, then $U$ and $A$ are confounders i.e.
      age is a predictor for strokes. 
      $H$ is a mediator i.e. HIV has a casual effect on strokes.

\wde{(directed) Graph Representation}{
    A directed graph is a set of nodes connected by edges.
    Each vertex is a random variable and each edge represents a direct dependency.
    It is directed and acyclic (DAG).
    A distribution factorises according to the graph if 
    $$
    p(x_1, \ldots, x_n) = \prod_{i=1}^n p(x_i | \text{parents}(x_i))
    $$
